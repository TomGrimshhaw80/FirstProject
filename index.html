    <h1>Arsenals summer 2022 transfer business analysed</h1>
    <!-- a page looking at how Arsenal performed in the transfer window-->
    <h2>Have the gunners improved their squad ahead of the new season?</h2>
    <p>After a disappointing end to the 2021-22 season, Arsenal have once again spent big money in an attempt to improve their squad, £120m as of August 4th 2022. Lets take a look at how they did...firstly with a look at who has come in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Marquinhos - £3m</li>
        <li>Matt Turner - £6m</li>
        <li>Fabio Vieira - £30m</li>
        <li>Gabriel Jesus - £45m</li>
        <li>Oleksander Zinchenko - £30m</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Marquinhos</strong> is an unknown quantity. An opportunistic purchase, the right sided attacked will likely go on loan</p>
    <p><strong>Matt Turner</strong> is the US national goalkeeper, but will be an adequate backup to Ramsdale</p>
    <p><strong>Fabio Vieira</strong> is statistically one of Europes best attackers, but will likely be a backup to the attacking players</p>
    <p><strong>Gabriel Jesus</strong> is a maquee, game changing signing, and likely to be up their with the PLs best players this season</p>
    <p><strong>Oleksander Zinchenko</strong> will make a huge difference in the build up phase, and add immense technical quality</p>
    <p>In terms of <em>MY PERSONAL</em> thoughts on the relative quality of our signings:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Gabriel Jesus</li>
        <li>Oleksander Zinchenko</li>
        <li>Fabio Vieira</li>
        <li>Matt Turner</li>
        <li>Marquinhos</li>
    </ol>
